This package is meant to help views researchers with training models, by
providing a common interface for data partitioning and stepshift model
training. It also functions as a central hub package for other classes and
functions used by views researchers, 
including [stepshift](https://github.com/prio-data/stepshift) (StepshiftedModels)
and [views_partitioning](https://github.com/prio-data/views_partitioning) (DataPartitioner).
